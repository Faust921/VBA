# VBA
This VBA was written to automate process used at a large manufacturing concern.
The previous methods were manual and involved 100's of 'v-lookups' per week.
These VBA subroutines do mostly a form of “validated transcription”, 
  previously done by someone playing excel like a piano every week for two years.
  
The code might be relevant for a modern enterprise for the file opening methods
which open specific worksheets and represent them like an object.

If you needed to open legacy spreadsheets and extract information and also check it before importing it,
  you might find some utility here. This was written to include a lot of manual interaction. 

One important note - I believe in opening the VBA in it's own file. 
Then I opening static data and in process logs in a second workbook.
Other sources and targets can be opened as needed.
