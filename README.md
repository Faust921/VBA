# VBA
This VBA was written to automate different types of transcription of data between spreadsheets involving 100's of repetitve 'v-lookups' per week. This code includes: opening files automatically or by selection, blank and replace lists, find rows and replace specific cells, add data if the matching index is not found, each being slightly different as needed. Some of the newer subs work in the 0365 environment 

If you needed to open legacy spreadsheets and extract information and also check it before importing it,
  you might find some utility here. These were written to include some manual interaction. 

One important note - I recommend running VBA tools in its own excel file, and handling source and target files outside of that file. I do not put my VBA in a source or target file.
